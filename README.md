# Help Contribute!
If you are working on the AUEG software project and run into errors, we would really appreciate your input! Your input would help inform what errors someone might run into when they are learning how the [UWMRO/Instruments](https://github.com/UWMRO/Instruments/) project repo works. Navigate to the following issues if you run into a problem:

- [React.js Issues](https://github.com/UWMRO/Instruments/issues/66)
- [Flask Server Issues](https://github.com/UWMRO/Instruments/issues/65)
- [Andor Pybind11 Issues](https://github.com/UWMRO/Instruments/issues/64)



# Scope and Philosophy
This tutorial series will not cover the basics of python. Instead, we will cover the basics of the libraries and tools listed above. The format of this tutorial series will focus on examples that are relevant to developing software on the project. We hope that learning by doing will help new project members get to contributing in a relatively short amount of time. Of course, feedback is welcome!
